# PokedexNgxs

## Purpose :

Practicing NGXS ðŸš€, with powerful pokedex.

I also tried to use `@anguar/material`'s VirtualScroll, with infinite scroll, but without keeping all data in app state (to manage big data set, without consume lot of ram ðŸ”¥).

I used `angular-in-memory-web-api` to mock API.

## Encountered problem :

- Async action dispatching order : https://github.com/ngxs/store/issues/139
